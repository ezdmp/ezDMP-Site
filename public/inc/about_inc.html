                <div style="text-align:left;">
                  Data Management Plans (DMP) are an important component of enabling 
                  reproducibility and are now required for most federally funded grants. 
                  The National Science Foundation(NSF) in particular, has created guidelines 
                  for producing these plans. Until recently, most data management plans have been 
                  free text, and it can be difficult for investigators to know exactly what NSF
                  requires or how it should be organized. Likewise, it can also be difficult for NSF to understand the
                  disposition of data resulting from research efforts. ezDMP was developed
                  to ensure that investigators provide everything that NSF wants to see in a clear, 
                  organized way and to allow NSF to collect meaningful analytics about data compliance.
                  <br><br>
                  ezDMP is based on the <a href="https://www.iedadata.org/">Interdisciplinary Earth Data Alliance (IEDA)</a> Data 
                  Management Tool and free to all investigators. The user interface
                  includes logic to that allows easy input and connection of 
                  proposed data products and provides suggestions and information
                  specific to the NSF directorate and subdiscipline to ensure that
                  users find the right solutions for long-term data management. Users
                  can then download an NSF compliant data management plan PDF that
                  can be submitted directly along with their proposal.

                  ezDMP is funded by an NSF EAGER grant to K. Lehnert and V. Ferrini 
                  (Columbia University, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1649703">1649703</a>), H.M. Berman (Rutgers University, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1649545">1649545</a>),
                  and V.C. Stodden (University of Illinois, Urbana-Campaign, <a href="https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=1649555">1649555</a>).
