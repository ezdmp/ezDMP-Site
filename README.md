# ezDMP Front-End Interface

These files comprise the front-end interface for ezDMP. All client-side logic is included.

An example of a DMP object used by this interface is available [here](DMPExample.md).

All ezDMP dictionaries will be documented an openly available for download when the site goes live. This project can either be implemented with the ezDMP API url included in the configuration folder or with a custom API, provided it manages DMP objects as documented in [the DMP Example](DMPExample.md). For security purposes, server side handling of user information is beyond the scope of this article. The ezDMP site uses JWT Authorization headers for this purpose with the Satellizer AngularJS library.
